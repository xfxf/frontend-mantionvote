## static version of django-mantionvote
#### https://github.com/xfxf/django-mantionvote

This is a static version of the website to allow frontenders to hack on
changes without requiring the full site configured.

Please submit Pull Requests back here + changes will be manually merged back to
the real Django templates.

*PLEASE NOTE*: This version of the code will probably lag behind the real
templates.  Please ping @xfxf to ensure changes are merged back here before
working on code (bugs may already be fixed, etc).
